		<p>My name is Brooks Robison. I'm 30 years old and am earning an Applied Associates degree
			in Software Engineering and a Bachelors of Science in Software Engineering. My family and I
			live in Washougal, WA and have since November of 2012.
			I have been a member of the church since I was baptized when I was eight and my parents are life-long
			members as well. I received the blessing of being able to serve a full-time mission in the
			Arizona Mesa Mission. I now have a beautiful wife whom I've known since the First Grade.
			We weren't 'dating' back then, just FYI. She was converted to the church in 2009, we reconnected
			not long after that, and the rest is history. We have two beautiful children. My beautiful daughter,
			Serena, is 2 and half years old. She is the most amazing person my wife and I have ever known. We have
			an out of the box, almost brand spanking new baby boy, SJ (Scott James). He is almost 7 months old and is
			the sweetest and happiest baby boy on the planet. We named him Scott James after my father and my father-in-law.
			We did this, not only to pay respect to our fathers, but to memorialize my father, in particular. He was diagnosed
			with glioblastoma, a brain tumor, in November of 2014, and passed away in March of 2016 as a result.
			I love him and miss him everyday. <p>
			<br>
		<p>I know that my Savior lives. I know that he loves me and under the direction of our Father in Heaven, created this
			earth and all things in it. I know that this creation was to prepare a place for our Father's plan to
			come to fruition. I know that this plan is perfect and that families are eternal. The powers of heaven are real.
			The atonement of Jesus Christ is real and is the mechanism through which we all can be sealed by the Holy Spirit
			of Promise and return to live with Him again. I know the Book of Mormon is the true word of God and the
			most correct book ever published. I know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God and I know this by his fruits.
			His current successor, Thomas S. Monson, is a prophet of God and receives divine direction from our Savior. This
			is the Lord's church and I love Him. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<p>
