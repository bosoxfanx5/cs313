### Description
Overview
The purpose of this assignment is to review a minimal level of client-side programming and provide a homepage from which you can link to future assignments.

Guidelines
The following guidelines are a minimum standard for this assignment (required for a 93%). To earn a 100% on the assignment, you will need to go above and beyond this standard to show your creativity and ingenuity.

MINIMUM STANDARDS:

Professional look and feel

Do not use an HTML generator/layout program (e.g., DreamWeaver, FrontPage, Visual Studio designer tools). Please write the HTML for this page from scratch. You are, however, welcome to use jQuery, or Bootstrap, or other libraries if you would like.

Put all styles in an external stylesheet. (No inline styles.)

Have at least two pages: one as an introduction to yourself and one that will have links to assignments. (For now the assignments page can say "Coming soon" or something similar).

At least one image

Something dynamic (e.g., mouse-overs, menus, on-click, on-change, etc.)

Include reasonable colors, images, etc. to show your creativity and personality (but don't forget to keep it somewhat professional).

No run-time errors

As always, you are strongly encouraged to go above and beyond these guidelines.



## <a href="https://mysterious-bayou-55662.herokuapp.com/survey.php">Survey</a>

### Description
Overview
Create a simple PHP form that allows users to cast votes for certain questions and see the results.

Guidelines
The following guidelines are the minimum standard for this assignment (to earn 93%). To earn 100%, you should find a way to go beyond this standard to show your creativity and personality. Have fun and make it your own!

Your survey/results should look professional.

There should be at least four questions.

Provide a link on the question page to go directly to the results (without voting).

When the user casts their vote, they should then see the results.

Store the results to a file on the filesystem so they can be retrieved/added to later.

If the user returns to the question page after they have voted, they should be automatically directed to the results. (Think sessions)

Create a link to your survey from your assignments page.

### Description
Overview
For the first half of the semester, we will be working on individual projects with a portion of the assignment due each week.

The purpose of this project is to further develop your understanding of server-side web development concepts and to learn and apply good practice in database design/interaction.

The guidelines in this document should be considered a minimum standard for what is expected, but as always you are encouraged to go above and beyond to learn as much as you can.

Project Guidelines
Design and implement a straightforward database driven web application in PHP. This project should allow you to demonstrate proficiency in the following areas:

Client-side development principles (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.)

Basic PHP development

Session handling in PHP

Database design concepts, including foreign key relationships

Database setup and queries

Database retrieval in PHP

Database modification from PHP

You may propose whatever project you like as long as it allows you to demonstrate these skills.
